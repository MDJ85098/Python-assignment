Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Ans. Python can be used in many in various domain like web applications, data science, machine learning, AI mobile app, testing automation,etc its very easy to learn and implement that is why it is refered as a general purpose and high level programming language

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Ans. When the code is run in Python the data type of the variable is not known, it store the value of some memory location and then binds that variable name to that memory container and makes the content of the container accessible through that variable name so the data type does not matter as it will get to know the type of the value at runtime that is why the python is called a dynamically typed language.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Ans.Pros 
    1. Easy to learn
    2. Easy for development beacuse of simple sysntax
    3. Can be used in any OS mac os windows and linux and the codes can be team up with other languages.
    4. It can be used for many purpose like data science, data engineering, devops etc which makes it widely used language 

    Cons
    1. Slower then C++ and java 
    2. No Multithreading beacuse of GIL(Global Interpreter Lock)
    3. It uses high resouces and high memory consumption
    4. No suitable for smartphones 

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

Ans. Web development, Machine learning, Data Science, Data Engineering, network and internet development.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

Ans. Variable are something which store value, Python is not statically typed, so we do not have to declare variable before using them or declare their type eg:-

#String
Name = "Junaid" 

#interger
Age = 23 

#Float
salary = 55245

print(Name)
print(Age)
print(salary)

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

Ans. Using input() we can take input (By default it will take input as string) eg:-

Name = input("Type the name ") 
Age = int(input("Type the age "))
print(Name)
print(Age)

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

Ans. By default it will take string as input

Q8. What is type casting?

Ans. Type casting is a way to force any datatype in a variable eg:-

Age = int(input("Type the age "))
print(Age)

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

Ans. Yes we can take more then one input using the single input() funtion by using Split() eg:-

x, y = input("Enter two values: ").split()
print(x)
print(y)

Q10. What are keywords?

Ans. Keywords in Python are reserved words that can not be used as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

Ans. No we cannot use keywords as a varibale beacuse they are case sensitive in python

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

Ans. Indentation is putting spaces before a statement to a particular block of code, we need to use indentation in python because it makes the code look clean and easy to understand and without proper indentation we might get IndentationError and the code will not get compiled. Eg:-

name = input("Type the name ")
 
if name == 'junaid':
    print('the name is junaid')
else:
    print('type the name again')
print('All set !')

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

Ans. We can throw output in python by using print()

Q14. What are operators in Python?

Ans. Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Eg:-

print(10 + 5)
print(10 - 5)
print(10 // 5)

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

Ans. / is regular division it return float and // is floor division it return int eg:-

print(10 // 5) #2
print(10 / 5) #2.0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0

Ans. 
1
0
False
1

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

Ans. Conditional statements in Python is a statement that accommodates a condition inside itself, A conditional statement always generates a boolean output that is either true or false. eg:-

a = int(input("Type the number "))

if (a % 2 == 0):
    print("The number is even")
else:
    print("The number is odd")

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

Ans. if elif and else keywords are conditional statements that accompdates a condition inside itself, for nested if else we can use elif
eg:-
if (a % 2 == 0):
    print("The number is even")
else:q
    print("The number is odd")

marks = 54

if marks>=90:
    print("Grade A+")
elif marks>=80 and marks<90:
    print("Grade A")
elif marks>=70 and marks<80:
    print("Grade B+")
elif marks>=60 and marks<70:
    print("Grade B")
else:
    print("Grade C")

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

Ans. 
a = int(input("type the first number = "))
b = int(input("type the second number = "))
c = int(input("type the third number = "))
d = 0

if a > b and a > b:
    d = a
if b > a and b > c:
    d = b

If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

Ans. 
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

for number in numbers:
    if number%5 == 0:
        if number > 150:
            continue
        if number > 500:
            break
        print(number)

Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?

print(lst)
print(lst[3])

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?

Ans. Tuple in python are a classes of Python Data Structures and the characteristics of it is static, and it is denoted with parenthesis. Eg:-.

tuple1 = (0, 1, 2, 3)
print(tuple1)


Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?

Ans. We can create a tuple in python using parenthesis. Eg:-

tuple1 = (0, 1, 2, 3)
print(tuple1[0])

Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.

Ans. No We can not do any changes in a tuple once it is created, but we can add another tuple with our name in the first tuple

t1 = ()
t2 = tuple(input("type the name = ").split()) + t1
print(t2)

Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?

Ans. Yes we can append two tuple

t = tuple(map(int, input("Type the first tuple = ").split()))
print("first tuple is = ", t)

print("after adding = ", t1)

for i in t1:
    print(i)


Q44. Take a tuple as an input and print the count of elements in it.

Ans. 
tuple_1 = tuple(map(int, input("Type the input for tuple = ").split()))
print(tuple_1)
print(type(tuple_1))
print(len(tuple_1))

Q45. What are sets in Python?

Ans. In Python, a set is an unordered collection of items. Sets are often used to store multiple items in a single variable. Unlike lists or tuples, sets are unordered and do not have a specific index.

Q46. How can you create a set?

Ans. Set_1 = {'big', 'data', 'engineer'}
print(Set_1)
print(type(Set_1))

Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.

set_1.add("iNeuron")
print(set_1)


Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function.

Ans. 
set_1 = set()

for i in range(5):
    set_1.add(input("type the values for set = "))

print(set_1)


Q49. How is update() different from add()?

Ans. In Python, the set.update() method is used to add multiple elements to a set at once, whereas the set.add() method is used to add a single element to a set.

Q50. What is clear() in sets?

Ans. In Python, the set.clear() method is used to remove all elements from a set. It empties the set, leaving it with a length of 0.

Q51. What is frozen set?

Ans. A frozen set in Python is an immutable version of a set. Frozen sets are sets that cannot be modified once created.

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?

Ans. A frozen set is an immutable version of a set in Python. This means that once you create a frozen set, you cannot modify it. You cannot add or remove elements from a frozen set, and you cannot clear a frozen set.
On the other hand, a regular set is a mutable object in Python. You can add or remove elements from a set, and you can clear a set using the set.add(), set.remove(), and set.clear() methods, respectively.

Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.

Ans. In Python, the union() method of a set is used to return a new set that contains all the elements of the original set and all the elements of another set or iterable. The union() method does not modify the original set, it returns a new set that contains the combined elements.

set_1 = set()
set_2 = set()
set_1.update(map(int, input("type the value for first set = ").split()))
set_2.update(map(int, input("type the value for second set = ").split()))
print(set_1.union(set_2))

# output
# type the value for first set = 1 2 3
# type the value for second set = 3 4 5
# {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.

Ans. In Python, the intersection() method of a set is used to return a new set that contains only the elements that are common to both the original set and another set or iterable. The intersection() method does not modify the original set, it returns a new set that contains the common elements.

set_1 = set()
set_2 = set()
set_1.update(map(int, input("type the value for first set = ").split()))
set_2.update(map(int, input("type the value for second set = ").split()))
print(set_1.intersection(set_2))

# output
# type the value for first set = 1 2 3
# type the value for second set = 3 4 5
# {3}

Q55. What is dictionary in Python?

Ans. In Python, a dictionary is a data type that stores a collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are unordered and changeable, and they are used to store data values like a map, which can be retrieved with a key.

Q56. How is dictionary different from all other data structures.

Ans. A dictionary is a data structure that stores a collection of keys and their corresponding values. It is similar to a list or an array, but unlike these data structures, a dictionary can store data of different types and can be used to store data in a more organized and meaningful way.

Q57. How can we delare a dictionary in Python?

Ans. In Python, you can declare a dictionary using curly braces {}.
Eg :-
my_dict = {}

Q58. What will the output of the following?

var = {}
print(type(var))

Ans. <class 'dict'>

Q59. How can we add an element in a dictionary?

Ans. 
my_dict = {'name': 'Junaid', 'age': 23, 'city': 'Kolkata'}

Q60. Create a dictionary and access all the values in that dictionary.

Ans. 
my_dict = {'name': 'Junaid', 'age': 23, 'city': 'Kolkata'}
print(my_dict['name'])
print(my_dict['age'])
print(my_dict['city'])

for key in my_dict:
    print(key, " : ", my_dict[key])

Q61. Create a nested dictionary and access all the element in the inner dictionary.

Ans.
my_dict = {'name': 'Junaid', 'age': 23, 'city': 'Kolkata'}
my_dict["More details"] = {'Heignt': 170 , 'Weight': 57}
print(my_dict['More details']['Heignt']) 

# output 170

Q62. What is the use of get() function?

Ans. In Python, the get method is a built-in function that is used to retrieve the value for a given key from a dictionary. 
It is a convenient way to access the elements of a dictionary, because it returns the value for the given key if it exists in the dictionary, and returns a default value (None by default) if the key is not found
Eg:-

my_dict = {'name': 'Junaid', 'age': 23, 'city': 'Kolkata'}
print(my_dict.get('name'))

#output
#Junaid

Q63. What is the use of items() function?

Ans. In Python, the items method is a built-in function that is used to retrieve a list of tuples containing the key-value pairs in a dictionary. Each tuple consists of two elements, the key and the value, in that order.
eg:-
my_dict = {'name': 'Junaid', 'age': 23, 'city': 'Kolkata'}
print(my_dict.items())

#output
#dict_items([('name', 'Junaid'), ('age', 23), ('city', 'Kolkata')])

Q64. What is the use of pop() function?

Ans. In Python, the pop method is a built-in function that is used to remove a key-value pair from a dictionary and return the value for that key. If the key is not found in the dictionary, the pop method can return a default value (None by default).
Eg:-
my_dict = {'name': 'Junaid', 'age': 23, 'city': 'Kolkata'}
print(my_dict.pop('city'))
print(my_dict)

#output
#Kolkata
#{'name': 'Junaid', 'age': 23}

Q65. What is the use of popitems() function?

Ans. In Python, the popitem method is a built-in function that is used to remove and return an arbitrary key-value pair from a dictionary. The key-value pair that is removed is chosen using a Last In, First Out (LIFO) policy, which means that the most recently added key-value pair is the one that is removed.
Eg:-
my_dict = {'name': 'Junaid', 'age': 23, 'city': 'Kolkata'}
print(my_dict.popitem())
print(my_dict)

#output
#('city', 'Kolkata')
#{'name': 'Junaid', 'age': 23}

Q66. What is the use of keys() function?

Ans. In Python, the keys method is a built-in function that is used to retrieve a list of the keys in a dictionary. The keys are returned in the order they were added to the dictionary.
eg:-
my_dict = {'name': 'Junaid', 'age': 23, 'city': 'Kolkata'}
print(my_dict.keys())

#output
#dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'city'])

Q67. What is the use of values() function?

Ans. In Python, the values method is a built-in function that is used to retrieve a list of the values in a dictionary. The values are returned in the order they were added to the dictionary.
eg:-


my_dict = {'name': 'Junaid', 'age': 23, 'city': 'Kolkata'}
print(my_dict.values())

#output
#dict_values(['Junaid', 23, 'Kolkata'])

Q68. What are loops in Python?

Ans. In Python, a loop is a control structure that allows you to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or a set of elements (such as the keys in a dictionary). Loops enable you to repeat a block of code multiple times, and they are an essential tool for many types of programming tasks.

Q69. How many type of loop are there in Python?

Ans. There are two types of loops in Python: for loops and while loops.
eg:-

#print 1 to 5

for number in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    print(number)

counter = 0

# Print numbers from 1 to 5
while counter < 5:
    print(counter + 1)
    counter += 1


Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?

Ans. A for loop iterates over a sequence or set of elements, and executes a block of code for each element in the sequence.

A while loop executes a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

Q71. What is the use of continue statement?

Q72. What is the use of break statement?

Q73. What is the use of pass statement?

Q74. What is the use of range() function?

Q75. How can you loop over a dictionary?
